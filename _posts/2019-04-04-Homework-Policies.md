- Homework is assigned on Friday and is due the *following* Friday by 1:30pm. Assignments will be posted on canvas and the quiz section website.
- Grading is based on *effort* as well as *execution*.
- There are a total of **nine** homework assignments. We will drop the lowest homework grade.
- No late assignments will be accepted.
- Use resources wisely. It is fine to google/work in groups but don't copy!
- Don't use python modules that are obvious "shortcuts". Rule of thumb: don't use any modules we haven't used in class.
- The course is taught in `Python3`. Please submit your homework in `Python3` (see me if you have issues)
